            <h2>The Story</h2>
            
            <p>The people of Los Angeles do not have indoor water faucets &amp; sinks.  The existing system distributes water outside of the house into sinks or buckets which the people use for drinking, cooking and cleaning.  The water only runs for two four hour periods each day.</p>
            <p>Tests performed on the groundwater indicate that it meets drinking water standards in the US, but because the existing pipes have been poorly maintained there are numerous leaks that allow bacteria and other contaminants to pollute the system. Additionally, as the community has grown since the original system was installed, residents have spliced into the pipe using whatever techniques and materials were available. This has also caused leaks and significantly reduced flow rates at the ends of the pipes. Some families no longer get water piped to their homes.</p>
            <p>Most residents currently buy drinking water if they have the money and only use the public water for cleaning or cooking. If they donâ€™t have the money to buy water they are forced to drink the public water. Drinking water standards in Honduras are similar to those in the US, but there is not a system to check or enforce those standards. With the highest education in La Lima being equivalent to a 5th grader, and a lack of government support for training, many systems go without proper maintenance.</p>
            <p>Although power lines are available, the people of Los Angeles do not have the money to to pay for the electricity.  Only one household in Los Angeles has electricity.</p>
            <p>The small red water tower stores groundwater and distributes it to the people of Los Angeles.  It is in disrepair due to lack of maintenance.  The large white tower is owned by the government of the City of La Lima, is empty, and unused.  Unfortunately the government will not allow the people of Los Angeles to use the tower.</p>
            <p>Local contractors have the means to construct good quality infrastructure, but with the average resident of Los Angeles living on less than $$ per day, the community does not have the money to finance it.</p>
            <p>EWB-GT has made 3 site visits to Los Angeles to test the existing water system.   We are currently in the final phase of design and are preparing for construction.  We estimate the cost of raw materials for the piping system at $33,000 USD.</p>
